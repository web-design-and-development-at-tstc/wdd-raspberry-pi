## Install Apache on Ubuntu

- It is always a good idea to get in the habit of updating the package manager before installing new software.  Open the terminal and run the command `sudo apt-get update` and let it finish updating.

- To install Apache on Ubuntu, run the command `sudo apt-get install apache2` and type `Y` to give confirmation to install.

- It will take a few minutes for everything to install.

## Update Firewall Configuration

Since we have a firewall configured, we need to configure the firewall to allow connections to Apache.

- To add the firewall rules for Apache, run the command `sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"`.  You should get the output:  
  `Rules updated`  
  `Rules updated (v6)`

- You can check the current status of your firewall by running the command `sudo ufw status`.

## Verify Apache Installation

To verify Apache was installed correctly, open up a web browser on your Raspberry Pi and type in the address bar the IP address for your Raspberry Pi.  You should see a page labeled “Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page” as seen in the image below.

## Publish Web Sites

To publish websites on your Raspberry Pi web server, you will need to place all files and directories inside the Apache document root directory located at `/var/www/html`.
